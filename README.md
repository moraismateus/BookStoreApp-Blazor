This is being done following a tutorial/course on Udemy by Trevoir Williams, but I am modifying it according to my preferences(like using docker instead of MS SQL Server, custom implementation of NSwag, different code style...).

Work in progress... :)

Personal TODO in this project(not included in the tutorial):
Upgrade it to .NET 8
Make it use WASM
Implement MudBlazor
Implement ReactiveUI
Use MVVM
Modify it to use Minimal API
Create Dockerfile to implement database and hosting
Create MAUI APP that uses same UI and Services.
